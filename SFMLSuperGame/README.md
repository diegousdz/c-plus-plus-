## Acknowledgements

When I first decided to enroll to Image I was nothing but sceptical about if I could really learn c++ for games.

I think Classes after Classes the teacher help us understand the concepts and with our projects. I was able to solve
any doubts and apply it to my game. I appreciate the help and encouragement from our Family, friends and follower who contributed with feedback throughout the development
